## Streaming Info

### Cord Cutting

https://cordcuttersnews.com has great information on cord cutting. They also put out a daily 10-15 minute video on YouTube on the latest news.

https://www.techhive.com is another site I've found useful.

### Over the Air (OTA)

Currently there are 3 OTA Standards. ATSC 1.0 and ATSC 3.0. ATSC 1.0 is 720p resolution and will be supported until at least 2027. The new ATSC 3.0 standard requires new tuners and supports up to 4K, more channels than 1.0, on demand, and DRM. However, there are reports of many TV stations putting DRM encryption into their broadcasts and most (all?) of the OTA DVR's that support ATSC 3.0 do not support DRM. It's not known if / when those devices will support DRM.

I use the SiliconDust HDHomeRun Flex Quatro for my ATSC 1.0 OTA DVR with my Channels-DVR Docker container on my NAS. It can receive 4 OTA channels at the same time. It's $150 on Amazon.

### Downloading from Streaming sites

StreamFab is the application I use to download movies / shows from streaming services:
  https://www.dvdfab.cn

I did NOT get their subscription plan, but got their All-In-One (Lifetime) purchase. It is currently on sale for $280. There is a 30 day free trial.

StreamFab allows me to download movies / shows from lower priced ad-supported services like Hulu / Amazon Prime without the ads.

### Recording and Viewing media library

I can't say enough about Channels-DVR. It is the application I use to record OTA broadcasts. However, it's app is not supported on Roku devices. You can use Google TV, Amazon Fire, and Apple TV devices.

It is an $8 per month or $80 per year subscription. It is available at:
  https://getchannels.com/
  There is a free 30 day trial.

Channels-DVR is very much like Plex, but has many more features. It has support for TV Everywhere which is what live TV streaming services (YouTube TV / Hulu Live TV / Sling / Etc.) use. This allows you to record OTA and cable channels like A&E, TBS, Etc. if you subscribe to a streaming service that streams those channels.

It can auto-skip commercials on shows in your media library, but is not 100% accurate.

You can also setup custom channels within Channels-DVR. For example one of my custom channels is dedicated to The Big Bang Theory. It shows up in the channel guide and continuously plays episodes one after the other. It's good for when cleaning house as a background.

I've also setup a collection of kids shows that my grandson uses to watch shows he likes.

I bought a Plex lifetime license years ago before I found out about Channels-DVR. However, my kids have Plex accounts so they can stream my media library over the internet.

Channels-DVR keeps track of what episodes of shows have been watched so you can just start watching from where you left off. Plex has this feature too.

It also has the ability to integrate internet m3u playlists like Plex's live TV. However, I have not put time into getting any of those setup.

### NAS / Media Library

For NAS storage, I recommend buying a high capacity USB drive and shucking the case for just the drive. These are usually cheaper than buying just the drive. 5400 RPM drives are good enough for Plex streaming

As of 4/21/25, Amazon has Western Digital 16 TB for $290.

Plex and Channels-DVR are available as Docker containers for Synology NAS's.

## Utah Paper Filing Instructions
Jeffrey and Sherry Trusty

Due Date:
Your Utah income tax return is due on April 15, 2025.

Where to file:
Utah State Tax Commission
210 North 1950 West
Salt Lake City, UT 84134-0260

You can track the status of your income tax refund by visiting Utah's Taxpayer Access Point. [tap.utah.gov]

Each return the Utah Tax Commission receives is different, and processing time will vary. Due to their efforts to protect your identity, please allow 120 days from the date you filed your return or 120 days from March 1 (whichever comes later) for them to process your return and refund.

URL: incometax.utah.gov/refunds

Refund Amount:
$428


You have elected to receive your refund via direct deposit.

Additional Information:
You must sign and date your return. If the return is a joint return, both spouses must sign. You do not need to send form(s) W-2, 1099R, 1099G, 1099MISC, TC-675R, Federal Schedule K-1 or other withholding forms. Instead, include schedule TC-40W, which collects all the necessary information from all forms reporting Utah withholding, on one page. This information is based on your entries in the Federal program. It is important that all requested information be entered to insure you are given credit for the Utah tax withheld. Do keep copies of all withholding forms with your records. Do not send a copy of your Federal return.

You are now asked to retain many of the required signature documents in your files rather than sending them with your tax return. Requirements vary depending on the document. If you have any of the following signature documents (TC-675H, TC-675M, TC-40E, TC-40H, TC-40LI, TC-40LIC, TC-40R, TC-40T, TC-40TB, TC-40TCAC, or TC-40V), signed copies of other state's tax returns (to support the credit for taxes paid to another state), or any other required documents, see the detailed information for each document in the instructions or check the state website to determine if your form must be enclosed with your tax return, or retained with your tax records.

Where's my Utah refund?
Due to our efforts to protect your identity, please allow 120 days from the date you filed your return or March 1, whichever is later, to process your return and refund request. Please remember that the Tax Commission cannot issue refunds before March 1st if it cannot verify your W-2s with your employers. Use the "Where's My Refund" tool to track the status of your refund, http://incometax.utah.gov/refunds
